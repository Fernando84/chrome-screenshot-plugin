# Chrome Extension Development Requirement: One-Click Full-Screen Screenshot

## Requirement Overview
Develop a personal Chrome extension that allows users to take a complete screenshot of the entire browser page (including parts beyond the visible area) by clicking the extension button or pressing a shortcut key. No need for manual scrolling or segmented screenshots, directly generate a complete long screenshot.

## Main Features

### 1. One-Click Screenshot
-  **Press a shortcut key** to immediately capture a complete long screenshot of the current webpage.
- Use **scroll stitching** or **Chrome's built-in API** to ensure the completeness of the screenshot.

### 2. Screenshot Preview and Save
- After capturing, display a preview of the screenshot in the extension popup or sidebar.
- Provide options to **download as PNG / JPG**.

### 3. Other Features (Optional)
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Support one-click copying of the screenshot for easy pasting into other applications.

## Technical Implementation
- **Event Listening**: Listen for shortcut keys and extension icon click events.
- **Screenshot API**: Use `chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab` or `chrome.debugger` to achieve full-page screenshots.
- **Image Stitching** (e.g., `HTML2Canvas`): Used for handling very long pages.
- **File Storage**: Provide options to download the screenshot or save it to `chrome.storage.local`.

## Reference Implementations
- **Awesome Screenshot**: Refer to its long screenshot feature.
- **GoFullPage**: Learn from its scrolling screenshot logic.
